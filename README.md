# nvim
My neovim rice on its own repo

After making sure you have neovim stable installed. <br>
run `sudo/doas ./install-libs` for GNU/Linux, in Mac dont use sudo, you will be asked for password later on


if there is any significant error I am sure you can solve it in your own by using `:checkhealth`

After everything is installed run `:PackerSync`, once it's done reboot neovim
